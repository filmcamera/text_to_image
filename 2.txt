You're arguing with him
Sometimes I cry because of that
When I'm in trouble, I feel hope
I don't know anyone
When you smile, you become calm again

Maybe you will know my heart
If we know it, we'll be far away
I breathe
Bite my lips again
Please leave him and come to me

Baby please don't hold his hand
Cuz you should be my Lady
Look back at me for a long time

When the song rings you are now
I'll be with him forever.
I will not come today
So I prayed every night
The wedding dress you wear
The wedding dress you wear
The wedding dress you wear

I didn't know my heart
I hate you so much
Sometimes I wanted you to be unhappy
My tears are already dry
I talk to you like a habit

Every night I was so nervous
Maybe I knew it would be like this.
I close my eyes
Have an endless dream
Please leave him and come to me

Please be happy with him
To forget you
Forget all my poor looks
For a while
I might be hard enough to die, but no oh

In a long time mistaken
I lived alone like a fool
Still mine she see me
I'm laughing white
